# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on creating a new repository on GitHub, cloning it to your local machine, making changes, and pushing them back to the GitHub repository using Git.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
2. Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and select "New repository."
3. Enter a repository name, add a description if needed, and click "Create repository."

## Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine

1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Use the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the URL of your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

## Step 3: Make Changes to a File

1. Go to the cloned repository on your local machine.
2. Make changes to any file using your preferred text editor or IDE.

## Step 4: Commit Changes

1. In the terminal, navigate to the repository.
2. Use the following commands to commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

## Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub

1. Use the following command to push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   (Note: Replace `main` with the name of your branch if it's different.)

Now, your changes are pushed back to the repository on GitHub. You can check your GitHub repository, and you should see the updated file with your changes.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
